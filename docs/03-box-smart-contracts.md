### Smart Contract Architecture

Evidence Market uses modular smart contracts deployed on **Oasis Sapphire** (an EVM-compatible privacy public chain). Confidential data is stored on-chain in encrypted form, and permissions are verified via SIWE tokens.

**Core Modules**

- `AddressManager.sol`: Uniformly manages core contract addresses, DAOs, supported tokens, and DEX whitelists.
- `SiweAuth.sol`: SIWE identity authentication, supporting multi-domain verification and adapting to Sapphire zero-address scenarios.
- `UserManager.sol`: User ID/Blacklist management, used as contract event log parameters to protect on-chain identity privacy.
- `EvidenceBox.sol`: The core asset contract, managing the state machine, pricing, and deadlines, using Sapphire TEE to store confidential data encryptedly.
- `Exchange.sol`: The trading engine, handling the full process of Sell/Auction/Buy/Bid/Refund/Complete.
- `FundManager.sol`: Fund custody and distribution, responsible for multi-currency payments, automatic exchange (DEX interaction), and yield distribution.
- `Forwarder.sol`: ERC2771 relayer proxy interaction contract.
