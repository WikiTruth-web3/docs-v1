Evidence Market uses modular smart contracts deployed on **Oasis Sapphire** (an EVM-compatible privacy public chain). Confidential data is stored on-chain in encrypted form, and permissions are verified via SIWE tokens.

### Base Modules

- `AddressManager.sol`: Uniformly manages core contract addresses, DAOs, supported tokens, and DEX whitelists.

- `SiweAuth.sol`: SIWE identity authentication, supporting multi-domain verification and adapting to Sapphire zero-address scenarios.

- `UserManager.sol`: Generate user IDs and manage blacklists for users, replacing addresses as contract event log parameters to protect on-chain identity privacy. [Read more](/docs/user-privacy).

- `Forwarder.sol`: Implements `ERC2771` standard meta transactions, supports gasless payment interactions, and ensures that user addresses do not directly interact with the contract.

### Evidence Blind Box

- `EvidenceBlindBox.sol`: The core asset contract, managing the state machine, pricing, and deadlines, using Sapphire TEE to store confidential data encryptedly.

- `Exchange.sol`: The trading engine, handling the full process of Sell/Auction/Buy/Bid/Refund/Complete.

- `FundManager.sol`: Fund custody and distribution, responsible for multi-currency payments, automatic exchange (DEX interaction), and yield distribution.

### Bounty Token

> The Bounty Token is still under development and has not been deployed to the testnet.
