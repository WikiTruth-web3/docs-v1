# Privacy Ecosystem Dilemma and Cross-Chain Exploration

Evidence Market's core mechanisms (such as TEE encryption/decryption of evidence, EIP-712 anonymous relayer execution, and privacy token settlement) are heavily dependent on the EVM-compatible privacy computing capabilities provided by **Oasis Sapphire**.

However, while enjoying its powerful security and privacy features, we must also honestly face the early stage of the current privacy public chain track and the resulting infrastructure dilemmas.

## 1. Current Status and Dilemmas of Privacy Public Chains

Although Oasis Sapphire has achieved a breakthrough at the technical base layer, there are still obvious shortcomings at the ecosystem application layer:

### Lack of a Truly Complete Privacy Token Ecosystem

The current EVM ecosystem is accustomed to fully transparent ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. Although the community is advancing token standards that support confidential balances like `ERC20Secret` or `ERC1363`, these standards **have not yet formed a broad market consensus**. This means that once a user's funds enter a purely private state, their on-chain use cases and compatibility are greatly reduced.

### Lack of Prosperous DeFi Infrastructure and Liquidity

A complete Web3 commercial closed loop cannot do without the deep liquidity support of DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges), lending protocols, and mainstream stablecoins (such as USDT/USDC).
Currently, the native DeFi infrastructure on the Oasis chain is relatively weak, lacking sufficiently deep liquidity pools. This leads to:

- After whistleblowers receive `EMC.Privacy` bounties, it is difficult to swap them into stablecoins on the local chain with extremely low slippage.
- When external buyers want to purchase a Evidence Box, they also face the cumbersome barrier of cross-chain bridging fiat or mainstream cryptocurrencies to Oasis and purchasing dedicated tokens.

## 2. Evidence Market's Cross-Chain Breakthrough Strategy

In response to the above dilemmas, the Evidence Market team has formulated a technical roadmap of **"Adhering to the privacy foundation, embracing omnichain liquidity"**.

### Separation of Privacy Execution Layer and Liquidity Layer

We believe that **absolute privacy** and **abundant liquidity** are difficult to achieve simultaneously on a single chain at this stage. Therefore, our architectural design strips these two apart:

- **Execution Layer (Must be on Oasis Sapphire)**: The minting of Evidence Boxes, state machine transitions, key releases, and the final step of anonymous intelligence settlement—these life-and-death logics must be executed on the TEE privacy chain.
- **Liquidity Layer (Distributed across mainstream EVM public chains)**: The main trading of the `EMC` token, liquidity mining, and stablecoin swap pools will be deployed on high-liquidity networks such as Ethereum, Arbitrum, or BSC.

### Actively Exploring Cross-Chain Bridging Solutions

To connect these two layers, we are actively exploring and testing deep integrations with mainstream cross-chain protocols (such as Celer cBridge, LayerZero, etc.) as well as the official Oasis bridge.

**Our future Omnichain experience vision is:**

1. A user holds ordinary USDT or `EMC` on Arbitrum.
2. When the user needs to purchase a blind box or post a bounty on Evidence Market, they can stealthily bridge and wrap their funds via cross-chain routing with one click to Oasis Sapphire, converting them into the privacy token `EMC.Privacy`.
3. When whistleblowers complete tasks and receive privacy bounties, they can similarly use a cross-chain bridge to "wash out" the funds and swap them back into anonymous addresses on other chains, thereby seamlessly plugging into the prosperous external DeFi world for monetization.
