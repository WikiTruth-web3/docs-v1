<!-- # Trading Mechanism & Roles -->

Evidence Blind Box ecosystem relies on the collaborative game theory of multiple roles. To ensure the system's decentralization and censorship resistance, we have designed a refined permission separation and incentive mechanism.

## 1. Key Ecosystem Roles

- **Minter**: Evidence Blind Box creator, i.e., the whistleblower.
- **Seller**: Other users acting as agents to sell the Box.
- **Buyer**: The user who pays to purchase/auction the Evidence Blind Box.
- **Bidder**: The user who participates in an auction but fails.
- **Completer**: Other users (non-Buyer and non-Minter) acting as agents to execute order completion.
- **DAO**: The highest authority entity for governance, parameter adjustment, blacklist processing, and transaction dispute arbitration.

## 2. Permissions and State Transitions

The smart contract strictly restricts the operational permissions of each role through a state machine.

## 3. Data Access Control (Privacy Access Control)

> Reiteration: The Evidence Blind Box trades access permissions, not the Box itself like an NFT.
